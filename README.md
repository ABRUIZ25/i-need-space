In this assignment you'll be using TWO APIs to create an application that allows you to find out the next time any satellite will be viewable over any address on earth!

The user of your application will enter some address and some satellite's ID (known as a NORAD), press 'search', then voila! They'll receive information on when that satellite can next be seen!

Check out the starter code for this project here:
